  "WhoAreWeBehindITTI":"Who are we behind ITTI?",
  "TeamITTI": "We are Daniela González and Juan David Serrano, two friends since we were 6 years old. We studied at the Universidad de los Andes and graduated in Engineering in April 2022. We started ITTI as a university project with the intention of creating a product that generates social impact. We believe that we can take advantage of technology to generate changes in the way we consume and purchase our products, especially in a country like Colombia where some sectors still lack a true digital transformation.",
